<p>This is Peter Park from a different dimension. In his universe he was heart broken, fat, and unhealthy. Neverless he was a hero to miles he taught him to be brave and to have a leap of faith once in a while. Which was ironic because he never ad the courage to go up to his love of his life and tell her that he was sorry for there relationship and would do anything to fix it.</p>
